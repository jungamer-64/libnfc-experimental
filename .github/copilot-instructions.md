# Copilot Instructions for libnfc

- **Core Layout**: `libnfc/` holds the C entry points (`nfc_refator.c`, `nfc-common.cpp`, `log.cpp`) and driver glue under `libnfc/drivers/`; shared headers live in `include/nfc/`, while CLI tools sit in `utils/` and sample apps in `examples/`.
- **Rust Bridge**: `rust/libnfc-rs/src/lib.rs` exposes connstring helpers and thread-local error buffers; CMake/autotools always build the Rust staticlib via the `libnfc_rs_build` custom target (see top-level `CMakeLists.txt` or `rust/Makefile.am`). Respect the contract described in `FFI_POLICY.md` whenever editing FFI.
- **FFI Safety Rules**: Exported Rust entry points must apply the `no_mangle` + `extern "C"` ABI, wrap logic with `ffi_catch_unwind`, return NULL (or sentinel errno) on panic/error for pointer/handle APIs, and avoid handing back borrowed buffers. Regenerate `rust/libnfc-rs/include/libnfc_rs.h` with `cbindgen --config rust/libnfc-rs/cbindgen.toml ...` and mirror any ABI notes into `FFI_POLICY.md`.
- **Thread-Local Errors**: `nfc_get_last_error`/`nfc_clear_last_error` surface Rust thread-local buffers; always call `nfc_set_last_error` on failure paths and clear it before returning success. When adding error codes, register them through the mapping rules in `FFI_POLICY.md` and avoid sharing buffers across threads.
- **Safe Memory Utilities**: Default to `NFC_SAFE_MEMCPY` / `NFC_SECURE_MEMSET` from `libnfc/nfc-secure.h`. Only fall back to raw `memcpy` in documented hot paths, backed by a benchmark note explaining the regression risk. The usage guide (`libnfc/NFC_SECURE_USAGE_GUIDE.md`) covers escalation patterns for both C and Rust ports.
- **Driver Discovery**: `nfc_list_devices` merges config files (`/etc/nfc/devices.d`) with runtime env vars (`LIBNFC_*`); keep that priority order intact. Optional devices must stay silent unless the probe succeeds, and every new driver ships behind a feature flag plus CI coverage across the flag matrix.
- **Build Workflow**: Standard loop is `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`, `cmake --build build`, and `cmake --build build --target libnfc_rs_build` when touching Rust; keep all generated artifacts in `build/` (never under `rust/libnfc-rs/include/` except the tracked header). Autotools users run `autoreconf -vis`, `./configure`, `make`, relying on a working `cargo`.
- **Testing**: Run `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` for the C suite, `cargo test -p libnfc-rs` for Rust, and `examples/ffi-sanity/` to exercise C → Rust → C loops (PRs touching FFI must pass this). Extend the ffi-sanity scripts whenever new externs or drivers land.
- **CI Expectations**: The planned pipelines (`ci/rust-sanity`, `ci/ffi-sanity`, `ci/full`) assume regenerated headers and artifacts live in `build/rust/`. Never commit generated outputs except the cbindgen header tracked under `rust/libnfc-rs/include/`.
- **Logging**: Prefer the structured `log_put`/`log_put_message` helpers (`libnfc/log.cpp`), guard every call against null devices, and register new categories via `LOG_CATEGORY` before emitting. Keep debug-only logs behind `LIBNFC_LOG` so CI log tests stay noise-free.
- **Docs to Consult**: `Rust.md` outlines the staged migration roadmap; scan it before large refactors to stay aligned with current phase. Security-sensitive changes should reference `SECURITY.md` and the memory guidelines above.
- **Absolute Prohibitions** *(break any and the migration backslides immediately)*:
	1. **Never let a panic cross the FFI boundary** — all exported Rust entry points must wrap work in `ffi_catch_unwind` (or equivalent) and normalize errors to NULL/sentinel codes. No `unwrap()` or panic-prone operations may run outside that guard.
	2. **Never free CallerFree pointers with raw `free()`** — when Rust hands ownership to C (via `CString::into_raw`, etc.), the paired `*_free` wrapper is the *only* release mechanism; bypassing it risks allocator mismatch and UAF.
	3. **Never change ABI without the regenerated header** — any FFI-visible change requires rerunning `cbindgen` and committing the updated `rust/libnfc-rs/include/libnfc_rs.h`, along with the checklist evidence from `FFI_POLICY.md` §7.
